# Home-Work-Challange5

In this home work challange the goal is to create a dynamic work schedule.

As a user you should be able to see a dynamic date and time being displayed. Once on the application you should see a schedule from 9-5. The Application allows a user to type an event and it also has a button on the right side to allow them to do a local save.
